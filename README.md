Vebiox OS
=========

Vebiox OS is an online operating system written in PHP, JavaScrippt, CSS and HTML. This project is not finished. Feel free to continue this project since I don't have time to finish it.
The interface is based on the Metro UI used by Microsoft. 

Some of the features:
* Multiple windows and windows management using a taskbar
* Easy application management
* User management
* Modal windows
* Notifications (not finished)
* Lockscreen

This project was first started by Vernon de Goede in April 2012 and has not been changed since June 2012. This application was meant for educational purposes only, so I never intended to finish it. However, anyone who would like to continue this project is allowed to do so. If you have any questions regarding this project, please contact me through GitHub.
